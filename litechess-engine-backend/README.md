## Litechess Engine Backend

The engine backend for Litechess is the same as that of Sunfish, except for the evaluation function which is a neural network in our case and piece-square tables in theirs. You can play against the engine by running uci.py or xboard.py depending on your system. Python libraries chess, pytorch and numpy are required before the game can be played.
